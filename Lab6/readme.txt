Our board can plot the temperature read from the LM335 temperature sensor, and print the temperature read on the python terminal so user can read the exact temperatures. The red LED flashes to let users know that the program is running.

Extra features:
1) prints actual temperature read on the python terminal for users to read
2) red led flashes to let user know program is running
3) has the window adjusted to better display the temperature graph
