Our code calculates freqency accurate to +/- 0.1, and phase difference accurate to +/- 0.1.

Extra Functions:
Ontop of displaying rms values, phase diff degree, and freqency, we added

1) Period was displayed for both waves (Period)
2) Peak voltage was displayed for both waves (PeakV)
3) Peak to Peak Voltage was displayed for both waves (PPV)
4) Time difference was displayed for both waves (tDiff)
5) Display loops through all displayed vaules
