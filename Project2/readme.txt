Functions:
Our robot is able to sense a coin, pick a coin up, place it in the coin box, and continue the search until all 20 coins in the perimeter has been found. The robot is also able to stay inside the perimeter for the duration of the search. Once all 20 coins have been found, the robot will stop. All the functions above can be performed automatically by the robot after human flips "on" switch. This may be used commercially to detect any metal objects and pick it up, allowing humans to stay in a safer environment while the robot performs dangerous tasks. It can also be used to detect mines.

Extra functions:
1) Resiliency - Does not break after large fall
2) Spins in "victory" after picking up 4 coins
